My research focuses on the application of computational chemistry and cheminformatics methods to support drug discovery projects.

I am particularly interested in integrating physics-based approaches with data-driven methods to address complex biological targets.

### Research topics
- Hit identification, hit to lead and molecular optimization
- Structure- and ligand-based modeling
- Ultra large virtual screening campaigns
- Databases and chemical spaces manipulation and exploration
- Pharmacophore, 2D and 3D similarity search
- QSAR / QSPR / ML / AI modeling
- Generative modeling
- Data analysis, workflow automation and coding
- DMPK / ADMET prediction and prioritization
- Docking, molecular dynamics and free energy predictions
