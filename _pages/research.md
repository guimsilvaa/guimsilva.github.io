## Profile
I am a Computational Medicinal Chemist with nearly ten years of academic and applied research experience in drug discovery. 

My work focuses on the integration of physics-based and data-driven methods to support hit identification, molecular optimization, structure–activity relationships, and mechanistic understanding of biological targets. My research spans multiple therapeutic areas, including CNS disorders, metabolic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and inflammation. 

I value scientific communication, mentorship, collaborations, and interdisciplinary environments - especially those including medicinal chemists, structural biologists, biochemists, and natural products researchers. My research is currently conducted in Brazil, therefore I push my efforts to work in projects comprehending the exploration of the Brazilian biodiversity as a rich source of bioactive chemical matter. I really enjoy contributing to projects that bridge fundamental science and translational applications.

My research philosophy is centered on combining different computational approaches to generate actionable scientific hypotheses in drug discovery. I am particularly interested in applying computational strategies to new and complex biological targets, where traditional workflows may be insufficient.

I actively engage in international scientific communities such as American Chemical Society (ACS) and Sociedade Brasileira de Química (SBQ). Beyond research, I'm a proud Brazilian, who enjoy and value our culture. I'm also a music lover and an enthusiastic vinyl records collector ;)
