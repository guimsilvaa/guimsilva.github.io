## Hi

Welcome to my website.

My name is Guilherme and I develop/apply computational methods for drug discovery. I'm passionate about hunting bioactive compounds as potential therapeutics, accompanied by the investigation of corresponding mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships. I am currently acting as a Research Scientist at the Brazilian Biosciences National Laboratory (LNBio), at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM).
