## About

I am a computational medicinal chemist with approximately ten years of academic and applied research experience in drug discovery. My work focuses on the integration of AI/ML and physics-based computational methods to support hit identification, molecular optimization, structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis, and mechanistic understanding of biological targets.

I have experience developing automated and reproducible computational workflows and collaborating in interdisciplinary environments involving medicinal chemistry, structural biology, high-throughput screening, and natural products research. My research spans multiple therapeutic areas, including CNS disorders, metabolic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and inflammation.

I am currently based in Brazil, where I conduct research at the interface of computational chemistry and drug discovery, contributing to projects that bridge fundamental science and translational applications.

## Professional Profile

My research philosophy is centered on combining data-driven and physics-based approaches to generate creative and actionable hypotheses in drug discovery. I am particularly interested in applying computational strategies to complex and challenging biological targets, where traditional workflows may be insufficient.

Beyond research, I value scientific communication, mentorship, and interdisciplinary collaboration. I actively engage in international scientific communities such as ACS and SBQ. I am also a music enthusiast and a record collector ;)
